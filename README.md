This is a forked version of [h2o's](https://github.com/h2o) http server written in C of the same name - [h2o](https://github.com/h2o/h2o).

It was forked from commit [c6c7e5ba77b593825bdbe20d439695d26114042b](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/commit/c6c7e5ba77b593825bdbe20d439695d26114042b).

The goal of this fork is to turn h2o into a fast, minimalist, middleware, web app framework - much like [Express](http://expressjs.com/) is for node.js.

Below is the start of original README.

Not only is it very fast, it also provides much quicker response to end-users when compared to older generations of HTTP servers.
